# Estas Tonne: A Modern Day Troubadour and His Discography
 
Estas Tonne is a musician who describes himself as a "modern day troubadour". He was born in 1975 in the former Soviet Union and started playing guitar at age 8. He later moved to Israel and then to New York, where he resumed playing guitar with violinist Michael Shulman. He eventually began to travel around the world as a solo musician, playing concerts, festivals, and street performances. He plays a 6-stringed classical guitar and a flute, and his music is influenced by classical, Romani, and fingerstyle genres. He is also vegetarian and has rarely stayed for more than a year at one place as an adult.
